        <p>The Icewind Dale Fixpack is designed to fix several bugs and errors that remain in the game after the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/943-official-patches-icewind-dale/">official       patches</a> have been applied. It works  with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster       installed. In fact, many issues quietly fixed by Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremaster have been rolled back       to every version of the game. This  is for the original Icewind Dale games, not the newer Enhanced Editions. </p>
        <p>This originally started as a component of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Tweak Pack, but was       broken out in to its own mod because 1) it's gotten fairly extensive on its own and 2) it should be installed       right after the official patches whereas the tweaks should be last installed. </p>

        <p>A good roundup of <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/24870-iwd-mod-install-order-thread/">install order for <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> mods</a> is available on the forums.</p>
        <p>The Fixpack works with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials      of the Luremaster. It should be installed after official patches but before other mods, with one exception.</p>
        <p> The Animation fixes for Icewind Dale: <acronym title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotLM</acronym> [<acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1pp</acronym>] mod can potentially nullify fixes--specifically, if       you install the 'enable combat stance animations' component and choose the 'Replace scripts' option. Using       the component with the 'Keep Old Scripts' option should be safe, and should follow the Fixpack in the install       order. Using the 'Replace scripts' option is <strong>not</strong> recommended, but if you insist, install it before the Fixpack. </p>
        <p>Auril's Bane also overwrites a number of files and introduces its own fixes, which are not as extensive as       the Fixpack. Because Auril's Bane also overwrites a number of files it can also negatively affect the fixes       provided by this mod.</p>

      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Icewind Dale Fixpack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> iwdfixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>

      <p>The Icewind Dale Fixpack has two components. If Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremaster is installed,       it will detect them and install relevant fixes for them as well.</p>
      <p><strong>Fixpack</strong></p>
      <p>This component contains the heavy lifting of the mod, fixing bugs and errors throughout the game. For       anyone familiar with the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack, the ideas behind identifying       and fixing bugs is equivalent. While some bugs are clearly bugs, the mod also has a review process for      'gray area' bugs to insure that fixes do not contradict developer intent.      The result is a component which aims to address true bugs      only and in a manner consistent with Bioware's original goals. <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwd_fixpack/iwd_fixpack_docs/">Complete documentation</a> is available on the <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> web site. Additionally, the complete <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/152-icewind-dale-mod-roundup/">Fixpack      forums</a> are open, so if you want to see the reasoning behind a bugfix      (or tell us we've got it all wrong), please join us on the forums and provide      feedback. If you find a bug that is not fixed, please report it. </p>
      <p><strong>Game Text Update</strong></p>
      <p>This component corrects various typos, errors, and other mistakes in the game strings. (A string is any bit       of text used by then engine--it could be a line of dialogue, an item description, a creature's name, etc.)       A <em>very</em> minimalist approach has been taken, in that strings are only introduced for obvious errors and not,       for example, to make formatting consistent in item descriptions. This component fixes about 400 strings, most of       which were string fixes silently introduced by <acronym title="Heart of Winter">HoW</acronym> or <acronym title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotLM</acronym> and now applied to every engine variant. The overwhelming       majority of these are to correct typos in the game though there are some notable exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Descriptions for the Incinerator and Frostbrand omitted their fire resistance bonuses</li>
        <li>In <acronym title="Heart of Winter">HoW</acronym>, the time required for Nym to enchant a shield for you         was reduced from ten to three days, but one line of dialogue was not updated to reflect this change</li>
        <li>Haste now mentions its fatigue effect</li>
        <li>The description for the Mage Dagger +4 omitted its <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> bonus and         had incorrect damage and <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> bonuses</li>
        <li>Several spells had incorrect schools listed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is by no means a comprehensive list.</p>
      <p>While this component is available for all languages, only the handful of string changes (seven or less) are       actually applied to non-English games. However, the framework is in place to expand these components (and       languages can alter strings independent of one another) so if any translating groups want to put together      a <acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> for their language, I'll be happy to include it in future versions. </p>
      <p>Regardless, for any language variant, I'll happily take corrections and fixes in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/152-icewind-dale-mod-roundup/">mod forum</a>. </p>

      <p>First, a big thanks to the wonderful community at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">The      Gibberlings Three</a>. Thanks to the still active and vibrant Infinity      Engine modding community. </p>
      <p>First, a huge thank you to devSin, my right-hand man and co-conspirator from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack. After version 1 of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Fixpack was released he was kind enough to share his own, personal       project he had put together for the game to fix a number of bugs. These fixes formed the backbone of the second       version of the Fixpack and helped correct some missteps in v1. </p>

      <p>Huge thanks to grogerson for his assistance, playtesting, bug reports, and suggestions, particularly for       the second generation of <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Tweaks, which led to this mod. Thanks       also to Daulmakan and the various unnamed guests who helped      report bugs and other issues. Thanks to Kaelas for the Talon of the Gloomfrost fix. Cheers      to Petor23 and Da_Venom for help testing! Version 2 also includes fixes reported (and in some cases fixed, too)       by plainab, redrake, Pacek, Ayrus, and Geeze. Big thanks to guest poster -Mike- on the <acronym title="Spellhold Studios">SHS</acronym> forums who helped identify (and fix) issues with       versions 2 and 3 of the mod. </p>

      <p><strong>Version 10 - December 17, 2022</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a CTD error in Tiernon's Sundered Shield introduced by the Fixpack (thanks eyre!)</li>
        <li>EE Fixpack identified several bugs in IWDEE that trace their way back to the original, which are now addressed:
          <ul>
            <li>Symbol of Pain's area-of-effect is a 30' radius, but the description listed a 60' radius</li>
            <li>Spell protections could partially shield the caster from the negative side effects of Great Shout</li>
            <li>If the party was split on either side of the closing door, the player could end up softlocked during the Yxunomei battle</li>
            <li>The overlapping containers in the Hall of Heroes are now fixed by removing one of them</li>
            <li>The range of Stone to Flesh scrolls was inconsistent</li>
            <li>The Sword of Days was not fully protecting its wielder from Haste and Slow effects</li>
            <li>The Elixir of Health now 'cures' intoxication rather than setting intoxication to zero</li>
            <li>Several  innate spells were set as 'generalist' school meaning that non-specialized mages received unwarranted save bonuses against them. In a handful of cases where there was a corresponding arcane/divine spell they were assigned the same school, otherwise they were made schoolless. </li>
            <li>The durations of effects on Retribution did not match</li>
            <li>Spell protections should not protect from the effects of Wall of Moonlight or Grease</li>
            <li>Depending on the level of the caster, Beltyn's Burning Blood could bypass or be blocked by the target's magic resistance. Previous versions fixed this by standardizing the spell to bypass MR, but after re-examination, it now is blocked by magic resistance. </li>
            <li>The portrait icons for feeblemind and petrification in Prismatic Spray did not match the durations of the underlying effects</li>
            <li>Free action should not block the movement penalty from Suffocate</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 9 - February 26, 2022</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Found a few more HoW-only parameters  being applied to non-HoW games, causing crashes</li>
        <li>The dialogue tree for Contact Other Plane would shift to the question/answer tree for TotLM events when the player started TotLM, but not shift back after TotLM events were completed</li>
        <li>Fixed the buggy <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/category/2-mod-albums/">Light Crossbow</a> and High Quality Light Crossbow icons (link is for BG2, but it's the same issue in IWD)</li>
        <li>Wind of Heaven does not fully protect against Death Fog despite the item's description. Unfortunately there's no way to fix this, so Wind of Heaven's description now mentioned that it only offers 'limited protection' against Death Fog since it only blocks the movement speed decrease</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 8 - January 27, 2022</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Several HoW-only effects were being applied to non-HoW games, causing crashes</li>
        <li>Waukeen's Defender was providing AC bonuses vs. missile attacks despite being a small shield</li>
        <li>Mantle of Hell's Furnace will no longer disappear when the item is out of charges. Also, clarified the text that the charm ability is for fire elementals</li>
        <li>Reverted a change to Trollslayer that fixed its damage; the damage was actually correct and not in need of a patch</li>
        <li>Due to a typo, the fix to make berserking effects apply more broadly was being applied to other effects on the item</li>
        <li>The fix to correct the Vocalize spell description was patching the wrong string</li>
        <li>Several non-dungeon areas had the dungeon flag removed, however, this also removed the ability to rest in these areas. As such, the change has been rolled back.</li>
        <li>GTU alters the 'Drink Potion' button to read 'Use Potion' to better reflect using items like the Oil of Second Chances</li>
        <li>The Protection from Petrification scroll was not being patched due to a typo, though the scroll is unused regardless</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 7 - December 1, 2021</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Systematic coding improvements:
          <ul>
            <li>Swapped custom functions to the native functions now in WeiDU itself</li>
            <li>In the interests of speed, swapped GAME_IS checks for variable checks, and external reference tables for pre-built arrays</li>
            <li>Other minor code modernization and optimization</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Corrections from previous versions:
          <ul>
            <li>Fixpack was adding a 'Blessed' icon to the Robe of Electrical Resistance instead of the correct 'Electrical Resistance' icon. </li>
            <li>Similarly Fixpack was not adding a 'Fire Resistance' icon to Hell's Bane due to a typo</li>
            <li>Tongue of the Gloomfrost's damage type was piercing while its description said slashing. Fixpack erroneously changed the item to slashing to match the descript, whereas it should be the description being updated to match the correct damage type on the item</li>
            <li>Expanded the fix for Sister Calliana not recognizing that Mother Egenia had been saved</li>
            <li>Fixpack fixed enemy priests to not cast healing spells on the party in the Severed Hand; however, healing spells won't work for them anyway since they're classed as undead. As such, the healing blocks in their scripting are disabled outright.</li>
            <li>A syntax error in Accalia's dialogue was fixed (an action in a trigger section) by updating the trigger, but Fixpack should be using the action in the proper field instead</li>
            <li>There was a duplicated random drop that provided either Ogien's Scale or the Cloak of Invisibility in the first and last area of the caves in the Sea of Moving Ice. Previously Fixpack replaced the duplicate entry in the cave entrance but, after examining the charges on both placements, it now updates the duplicate entry in the final area instead. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fire beetles had a missing attack sound due to a typo</li>
        <li>Fixed several bugs where a creature's animation was not matching the one set in the area where they appear</li>
        <li>The sleeping gnomes in the gnome camp were on an alternative 'team' than the other gnomes, meaning they would not respond if other gnomes were attacked and vice versa</li>
        <li>Several items which cast spells were not getting all of the fixes from the underlying spells applied to their casting: Shield Amulet, Wand of Corrosion, Fire Kiss, Force Bullets, Mace of Weal and Woe, Gauntlets of Infernal Damnation, Hand of the Gloomfrost, Tongue of the Gloomfrost, <span data-code-marker="+">Amaunator's Legacy</span>, Wand of Freezing Death</li>

        <li>The poison icon from the Poisonous Battle Axe +2 was expiring before the actual poison effect</li>
        <li>The Large Shield +1 of Missile Detection was re-using the description from the Reinforced Large Shield +1</li>
        <li>Items and spells that had an x% chance to do something were systematically off by 1%, e.g. the Dazer is supposed to stun on 5% of hits but was actually stunning on 6%. This fix also applies to enemy weapons and abilities.</li>
        <li><span data-code-marker="+">The War Hammer of Phasing +3</span> description says it caused disease on hit, instead of the correct phasing</li>
        <li>Elves and half-elves were not always getting their racial resistances to charm and sleep</li>
        <li>Because of the order of effects, targets who died were not getting the cosmetic effects that are supposed to accompany death from The Snow Maiden's Reaver, Death Spell,  Disintegrate, and Power Word Kill</li>
        <li>The War Hammer +4: Defender had a random healing effect, which is removed</li>
        <li>The berserk effect and bonus electric damage of Foe's Fate no longer overlap</li>
        <li><span data-code-marker="+">Blinding Darts +2</span> would blind on 25% of hits, but the complementary effects (feedback and icon) only occurred on 10% of hits</li>
        <li>The Hold Fast long sword only held humanoids, but would play all of the related effects on all targets, was also playing its hold sound effects on the wielder and not the target. A trap version of the Hold Person spell had the same issue. </li>
        <li>The Static Two Handed Sword +4 was supposed to do bonus electrical damage on 50% of hits and stun on 25% of hits, but was only causing these on 40% and 20% of hits, respectively</li>

        <li>The general fixes for creatures, items, and spells were reviewed and expanded significantly</li>
        <li>Clerics could talk to Kuldahar townspeople about Kresselack repeatedly for free garnet gems</li>
        <li>You could talk to Orrick repeatedly with the Mythal theory book for XP</li>
        <li>When rescuing Sheemish, he didn't always set the proper journal entry</li>
        <li>Armor of Penance, Kaylessa's Chainmail, High Quality Halberd, and Shadowed Plate now get unique names instead of generic names</li>
        <li>Kresselack's tomb shows up as trapped, however this is not a trap but  an internal script that prevents opening until you help Kresselack</li>
        <li>Stoneskin now grants the stated 1d4 + 1 skin/level instead of the current 2 + 1 skin/level. </li>
        <li>Much like the BG2 Fixpack, the IWD Fixpack now systematically detects immunities to effects and automatically provides the ancillary effects needed to round them out, e.g. an immunity to poison will now always block the poison icon</li>
        <li>Targeted charm effects, such as the Ring of Animal Friendship, will no longer cause  'charmed' messages or icons on creatures they cannot charm</li>
        <li>Spells which shouldn't stack previously would apply an effect for their duration that would prevent a second casting, meaning the second spell would simply be wasted. Fixpack now follows the EE model where it will dispel the previous casting and apply the new spell, allowing the ability to re-apply spells before they expire. </li>
        <li>The Priestess of Shar will now start hostile, like the rest of her Lonelywood posse</li>
        <li>The spell Shield was not blocking the concussive effects of Mordenkainen's Force Missiles or the Wand of Missiles</li>

        <li>You were able to comment that Edion was not a fisherman on branches where he never claims to be a fisherman</li>
        <li>One of the bard-specific replies to Hobart would cause the dialogue to exit prematurely</li>

        <li>Tracking information has been added for TotLM areas</li>
        <li>Horror was supposed to last one turn, not four rounds</li>
        <li>Casting speeds of 10 were systematically reduced to 9 as BG2 Fixpack did--spells which take an entire round can be interrupted at the very end of casting by the next round's AI scripting, wasting the round and spell</li>
        <li>Traps which do not affect non-party NPCs are no longer set off by non-party NPCs</li>

        <li>Shadows would play the string &quot;disease&quot; on themselves rather than the actual target of the attack</li>
        <li>&quot;Dead&quot; trolls could be finished with poison or disease; this is no longer the case. Their saves are also set to 20.</li>
        <li>Entropy Shield was not blocking several 'missile-based' attacks</li>
        <li>The bonus damage from Sunscorch applied only to undead; now it does bonus damage to myconids as well</li>
        <li>When learning about the location of the Barbarian Camp in HoW, the variable tracking whether or not you knew of the location was not always being set in tandem</li>
        <li>One version of the snow troll was not going through the 'dead' sequence that requires fire/acid to finish</li>
        <li>Added protection to prevent dead Crypt Things from teleporting</li>
        <li>The Planar Spirit from Contact Other Plane now has dialogue for TotLM, also now properly goes away if you don't ask a question</li>
        <li>The Bitch Queen's Envoy would cause all elementals to ignore the bearer, not just water elementals</li>
        <li>Beholders were scripted to cast Dispel Magic on themselves for no reason whatsoever</li>
        <li>Armor of Penance was not reducing the wearer's dexterity by one</li>
        <li><span data-code-marker="+">Morning Star of the Gods</span> was only adding one extra level one spell instead of two</li>
        <li>Tiernon's Sundered Shield was not providing resistance to missile weapons</li>
        <li>The upgraded  Sundered Shield was also not providing missile resistance in its one/day ability</li>
        <li>Damage for Burning Hands was wrong</li>
        <li>Several spells and items which measure durations in hours were using an incorrect formula to determine their durations (generally too long) and have been corrected: Invisible Stalker, Potion of Master Thievery, Animate Dead, Goodberries, Infravision, Giant Insect, Armor, Strength, Cat's Grace, Blindness, Cause Disease, Mind Blank</li>
        <li>The duration for the stun from Darts of Stunning was incorrect</li>

        <li>Sekolah's Fire bolts had a random +10 to-hit bonus</li>
        <li>Hell's Bane had the wrong fire resistance bonus; lacked the extra damage vs. Baatezu and Tanar'ri</li>
        <li>In Lower Dorn's Deep, the guard tower would shoot anyone who approached even if they were invisible. These shots were also supposed to be accompanied by taunting messages from the tower. </li>
        <li>Damage from Flame Blade was incorrect</li>
        <li>Chaos Dagger +3 is not supposed to have a save for its disease effect</li>
        <li>Ring of the Will-o-Wisp is given a short range to allow for better targeting</li>
        <li>Like their Cause inverses, Cure spells and HP draining abilities no longer work on undead or extraplanar creatures</li>
        <li>Blindness via Sunray should last 1d3 rounds, not a fixed two rounds</li>
        <li>Once you learn of Eidan's fate, townspeople will no longer talk about his mysterious disappearance</li>
        <li>Barbarians at the barbarian camp used all sorts of invalid racial values (e.g. SKELETON and GOBLIN) to facilitate the small civil war after Wylfdene's exposure, which caused spells to interact with them in unexpected ways. These are now fixed, and the AI handled in a better way.</li>
        <li>Summons are systematically checked and reduced to zero XP with no drops or corpses on their death. Several summons were also missed by the previous patch. </li>
        <li>Maiden Ilmadia was set to level 1 in her file, meaning she could perish without save to a Cloudkill</li>
        <li>Panic from Insect Plague was supposed to affect creatures of 5 HD and below, but was only affecting 4 HD and below; the duration of the accompanying portrait icon was also wrong</li>

        <li>Arrows from the shadowed creatures at Severed Hand are not magical, but were bypassing Protection From Normal Missiles</li>
        <li>Removed an extraneous header from the Council Letter</li>
        <li>The charm ability of Mantle of Hell's Furnace was affecting everyone, not just fire elementals</li>
        <li>If you were both under the effects of Grease and Entangle, you could sometimes move despite Entangle setting your movement speed to zero</li>

        <li>Several lizardmen were attacking with bare-handed animations despite having weapons</li>
        <li>Berserk effects from Foe's Fate, Berserker Darts,  Young Rage, and myconid spores can now trigger when enemies are not present</li>

        <li>Moved two Olive Slimes in the last dungeon area of Anauroch Castle to prevent them from being stuck in walls</li>
        <li>Despite their animations showing helmets, giants weren't actually equipped with them and were subject to critical hits</li>
        <li>Limited the effects of Produce Fire to once per round</li>
        <li>Monster Summoning I was trying to summon 2d4 monsters instead of the listed 2d3</li>
        <li>Marketh's premature attempt to leave could prevent a variable being set, meaning Ginafae wouldn't recognize he had left</li>

        <li>Using Stone-to-Flesh on a victim of the Gorgon Ring now destroys the ring to prevent a re-petrification</li>
        <li>Phasing damage was previously done internally through a disease effect, meaning that spells and effects that stopped disease or reduced poison damage would also affect damage from phasing. Phasing now does  magic damage directly. </li>
        <li>Disintegrate and Flesh-to-Stone were bypassing magic resistance</li>
        <li>Golems are now immune to a number of effects that rely on biology, e.g. cloud spells, poison, or disease</li>
        <li>If you were quick enough, you could kill Maiden Ilmadia without triggering hostility from the nearby fire giants</li>
        <li>Several dialogues could set journal entries about learning something before it was actually revealed in dialogue: Albion, Amelia, Angaar, Arundel, Brother Perdiem, Hjollder, Jhonyn, Kresselack, Soth, Vera, The Voice, Yxunomei</li>

        <li>The four knight's tales in TotLM and the prologue caravan contract are flagged as plot-critical items so that they'll survive disintegration and other effects</li>
        <li>Restored musical tracks to the top and bottom floor of the Tower of Labelas, the Order of the Kraken garden, and the third floor of the Temple of the Forgotten God; added music from the ground floor of Arundel's home to the second floor; all areas with music never played music at night</li>

        <li>Dead God's Dreaming provides an extra +2 vs. good, not +1</li>
        <li>Kaylessa's bow was not providing its +1 damage bonus for being a composite long bow. Same with the Composite Long Bow of the Hand. </li>

        <li>Crooked Flail and Skullflail were missing their +1 damage from being flails</li>
        <li>The generic heavy crossbow and the Finest Heavy Crossbow had the wrong minimum strength to use</li>
        <li>Trollslayer was doing 1d4+1 base damage, not the listed 2d4+1</li>
        <li>A handful of items had discrepancies between their listed and actual weight</li>
        <li>The cleric spell Find Traps would interrupt the caster every round for its duration with a casting animation. This was a bear to fix, but the revised version should detect traps without interrupting the caster. </li>
