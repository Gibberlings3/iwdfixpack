        <p>The Icewind Dale Fixpack is designed to fix several bugs and errors that remain in the game after the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/943-official-patches-icewind-dale/">official       patches</a> have been applied. It works  with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster       installed. In fact, many issues quietly fixed by Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremaster have been rolled back       to every version of the game. This  is for the original Icewind Dale games, not the newer Enhanced Editions. </p>
        <p>This originally started as a component of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Tweak Pack, but was       broken out in to its own mod because 1) it's gotten fairly extensive on its own and 2) it should be installed       right after the official patches whereas the tweaks should be last installed. </p>

        <p>A good roundup of <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/24870-iwd-mod-install-order-thread/">install order for <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> mods</a> is available on the forums.</p>
        <p>The Fixpack works with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials      of the Luremaster. It should be installed after official patches but before other mods, with one exception.</p>
        <p> The Animation fixes for Icewind Dale: <acronym title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotLM</acronym> [<acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1pp</acronym>] mod can potentially nullify fixes--specifically, if       you install the 'enable combat stance animations' component and choose the 'Replace scripts' option. Using       the component with the 'Keep Old Scripts' option should be safe, and should follow the Fixpack in the install       order. Using the 'Replace scripts' option is <strong>not</strong> recommended, but if you insist, install it before the Fixpack. </p>
        <p>Auril's Bane also overwrites a number of files and introduces its own fixes, which are not as extensive as       the Fixpack. Because Auril's Bane also overwrites a number of files it can also negatively affect the fixes       provided by this mod.</p>

      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Icewind Dale Fixpack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> iwdfixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>MacOS</strong><br />
        The Icewind Dale Fixpack for macOS  is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdfixpack</strong>, <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> iwdfixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Icewind Dale Fixpack for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not   include a WeiDU installer.  Linux users will need to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall iwdfixpack' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-iwdfixpack --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

      <p>The Icewind Dale Fixpack has two components. If Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremaster is installed,       it will detect them and install relevant fixes for them as well.</p>
      <p><strong>Fixpack</strong></p>
      <p>This component contains the heavy lifting of the mod, fixing bugs and errors throughout the game. For       anyone familiar with the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack, the ideas behind identifying       and fixing bugs is equivalent. While some bugs are clearly bugs, the mod also has a review process for      'gray area' bugs to insure that fixes do not contradict developer intent.      The result is a component which aims to address true bugs      only and in a manner consistent with Bioware's original goals. <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwd_fixpack/iwd_fixpack_docs/">Complete documentation</a> is available on the <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> web site. Additionally, the complete <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/152-icewind-dale-mod-roundup/">Fixpack      forums</a> are open, so if you want to see the reasoning behind a bugfix      (or tell us we've got it all wrong), please join us on the forums and provide      feedback. If you find a bug that is not fixed, please report it. </p>
      <p><strong>Game Text Update</strong></p>
      <p>This component corrects various typos, errors, and other mistakes in the game strings. (A string is any bit       of text used by then engine--it could be a line of dialogue, an item description, a creature's name, etc.)       A <em>very</em> minimalist approach has been taken, in that strings are only introduced for obvious errors and not,       for example, to make formatting consistent in item descriptions. This component fixes about 400 strings, most of       which were string fixes silently introduced by <acronym title="Heart of Winter">HoW</acronym> or <acronym title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotLM</acronym> and now applied to every engine variant. The overwhelming       majority of these are to correct typos in the game though there are some notable exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Descriptions for the Incinerator and Frostbrand omitted their fire resistance bonuses</li>
        <li>In <acronym title="Heart of Winter">HoW</acronym>, the time required for Nym to enchant a shield for you         was reduced from ten to three days, but one line of dialogue was not updated to reflect this change</li>
        <li>Haste now mentions its fatigue effect</li>
        <li>The description for the Mage Dagger +4 omitted its <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> bonus and         had incorrect damage and <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> bonuses</li>
        <li>Several spells had incorrect schools listed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is by no means a comprehensive list.</p>
      <p>While this component is available for all languages, only the handful of string changes (seven or less) are       actually applied to non-English games. However, the framework is in place to expand these components (and       languages can alter strings independent of one another) so if any translating groups want to put together      a <acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> for their language, I'll be happy to include it in future versions. </p>
      <p>Regardless, for any language variant, I'll happily take corrections and fixes in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/152-icewind-dale-mod-roundup/">mod forum</a>. </p>

      <p>First, a big thanks to the wonderful community at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">The      Gibberlings Three</a>. Thanks to the still active and vibrant Infinity      Engine modding community. </p>
      <p>First, a huge thank you to devSin, my right-hand man and co-conspirator from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack. After version 1 of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Fixpack was released he was kind enough to share his own, personal       project he had put together for the game to fix a number of bugs. These fixes formed the backbone of the second       version of the Fixpack and helped correct some missteps in v1. </p>

      <p>Huge thanks to grogerson for his assistance, playtesting, bug reports, and suggestions, particularly for       the second generation of <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Tweaks, which led to this mod. Thanks       also to Daulmakan and the various unnamed guests who helped      report bugs and other issues. Thanks to Kaelas for the Talon of the Gloomfrost fix. Cheers      to Petor23 and Da_Venom for help testing! Version 2 also includes fixes reported (and in some cases fixed, too)       by plainab, redrake, Pacek, Ayrus, and Geeze. Big thanks to guest poster -Mike- on the <acronym title="Spellhold Studios">SHS</acronym> forums who helped identify (and fix) issues with       versions 2 and 3 of the mod. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Version 7 - December 1, 2020</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Systematic coding improvements:
          <ul>
            <li>Swapped custom functions to the native functions now in WeiDU itself</li>
            <li>In the interests of speed, swapped GAME_IS checks for variable checks, and external reference tables for pre-built arrays</li>
            <li>Other minor code modernization and optimization</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Corrections from previous versions: 
          <ul>
            <li>Fixpack was adding a 'Blessed' icon to the Robe of Electrical Resistance instead of the correct 'Electrical Resistance' icon. </li>
            <li>Similarly Fixpack was not adding a 'Fire Resistance' icon to Hell's Bane due to a typo</li>
            <li>Tongue of the Gloomfrost's damage type was piercing while its description said slashing. Fixpack erroneously changed the item to slashing to match the descript, whereas it should be the description being updated to match the correct damage type on the item</li>
            <li>Expanded the fix for Sister Calliana not recognizing that Mother Egenia had been saved</li>
            <li>Fixpack fixed enemy priests to not cast healing spells on the party in the Severed Hand; however, healing spells won't work for them anyway since they're classed as undead. As such, the healing blocks in their scripting are disabled outright.</li>
            <li>A syntax error in Accalia's dialogue was fixed (an action in a trigger section) by updating the trigger, but Fixpack should be using the action in the proper field instead</li>
            <li>There was a duplicated random drop that provided either Ogien's Scale or the Cloak of Invisibility in the first and last area of the caves in the Sea of Moving Ice. Previously Fixpack replaced the duplicate entry in the cave entrance but, after examining the charges on both placements, it now updates the duplicate entry in the final area instead. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fire beetles had a missing attack sound due to a typo</li>
        <li>Fixed several bugs where a creature's animation was not matching the one set in the area where they appear</li>
        <li>The sleeping gnomes in the gnome camp were on an alternative 'team' than the other gnomes, meaning they would not respond if other gnomes were attacked and vice versa</li>
        <li>Several items which cast spells were not getting all of the fixes from the underlying spells applied to their casting: Shield Amulet, Wand of Corrosion, Fire Kiss, Force Bullets, Mace of Weal and Woe, Gauntlets of Infernal Damnation, Hand of the Gloomfrost, Tongue of the Gloomfrost, <span data-code-marker="+">Amaunator's Legacy</span>, Wand of Freezing Death</li>
        <li>Fixed power issues with the Staff of Besieging, Quost's Staff of the Elements, Wand of Monster Summoning, Shield Amulet, beholder innate abilities, Wand of the Heavens</li>
        <li>Thrym Extract was saving vs. Spell instead of vs. Death, and was not properly blocking effects on a failed save</li>
        <li>The poison icon from the Poisonous Battle Axe +2 was expiring before the actual poison effect</li>
        <li>The Large Shield +1 of Missile Detection was re-using the description from the Reinforced Large Shield +1</li>
        <li>Items and spells that had an x% chance to do something were systematically off by 1%, e.g. the Dazer is supposed to stun on 5% of hits but was actually stunning on 6%. This fix also applies to enemy weapons and abilities.</li>
        <li><span data-code-marker="+">The War Hammer of Phasing +3</span> description says it caused disease on hit, instead of the correct phasing</li>
        <li>Elves and half-elves were not always getting their racial resistances to charm and sleep</li>
        <li>Because of the order of effects, targets who died were not getting the cosmetic effects that are supposed to accompany death from The Snow Maiden's Reaver, Death Spell,  Disintegrate, and Power Word Kill</li>
        <li>The War Hammer +4: Defender had a random healing effect, which is removed</li>
        <li>The berserk effect and bonus electric damage of Foe's Fate no longer overlap</li>
        <li><span data-code-marker="+">Blinding Darts +2</span> would blind on 25% of hits, but the complementary effects (feedback and icon) only occurred on 10% of hits</li>
        <li>The Hold Fast long sword only held humanoids, but would play all of the related effects on all targets, was also playing its hold sound effects on the wielder and not the target. A trap version of the Hold Person spell had the same issue. </li>
        <li>The Static Two Handed Sword +4 was supposed to do bonus electrical damage on 50% of hits and stun on 25% of hits, but was only causing these on 40% and 20% of hits, respectively</li>
        <li><span data-code-marker="+">Pestilent Dawn</span> was not making its wielder immune to disease</li>
        <li>Cloudburst was supposed to do additional damage to fire/cold-using creatures, but this only occurred 50% of the time</li>
        <li>A couple of areas had ambient sound playlists with extra, blank entries; these are fixed</li>
        <li>The general fixes for creatures, items, and spells were reviewed and expanded significantly</li>
        <li>Clerics could talk to Kuldahar townspeople about Kresselack repeatedly for free garnet gems</li>
        <li>You could talk to Orrick repeatedly with the Mythal theory book for XP</li>
        <li>When rescuing Sheemish, he didn't always set the proper journal entry</li>
        <li>Armor of Penance, Kaylessa's Chainmail, High Quality Halberd, and Shadowed Plate now get unique names instead of generic names</li>
        <li>Kresselack's tomb shows up as trapped, however this is not a trap but  an internal script that prevents opening until you help Kresselack</li>
        <li>Stoneskin now grants the stated 1d4 + 1 skin/level instead of the current 2 + 1 skin/level. </li>
        <li>Much like the BG2 Fixpack, the IWD Fixpack now systematically detects immunities to effects and automatically provides the ancillary effects needed to round them out, e.g. an immunity to poison will now always block the poison icon</li>
        <li>Targeted charm effects, such as the Ring of Animal Friendship, will no longer cause  'charmed' messages or icons on creatures they cannot charm</li>
        <li>Spells which shouldn't stack previously would apply an effect for their duration that would prevent a second casting, meaning the second spell would simply be wasted. Fixpack now follows the EE model where it will dispel the previous casting and apply the new spell, allowing the ability to re-apply spells before they expire. </li>
        <li>The Priestess of Shar will now start hostile, like the rest of her Lonelywood posse</li>

        <li>Barbarians at the barbarian camp used all sorts of invalid racial values (e.g. SKELETON and GOBLIN) to facilitate the small civil war after Wylfdene's exposure, which caused spells to interact with them in unexpected ways. These are now fixed, and the AI handled in a better way.</li>
        <li>Summons are systematically checked and reduced to zero XP with no drops or corpses on their death. Several summons were also missed by the previous patch. </li>
        <li>Maiden Ilmadia was set to level 1 in her file, meaning she could perish without save to a Cloudkill</li>
        <li>Panic from Insect Plague was supposed to affect creatures of 5 HD and below, but was only affecting 4 HD and below; the duration of the accompanying portrait icon was also wrong</li>

        <li>Monster Summoning I was trying to summon 2d4 monsters instead of the listed 2d3</li>

        <li>Restored musical tracks to the top and bottom floor of the Tower of Labelas, the Order of the Kraken garden, and the third floor of the Temple of the Forgotten God; added music from the ground floor of Arundel's home to the second floor; all areas with music never played music at night</li>

        <li>Dead God's Dreaming provides an extra +2 vs. good, not +1</li>
        <li>Kaylessa's bow was not providing its +1 damage bonus for being a composite long bow. Same with the Composite Long Bow of the Hand. </li>

        <li>Crooked Flail and Skullflail were missing their +1 damage from being flails</li>
        <li>The generic heavy crossbow and the Finest Heavy Crossbow had the wrong minimum strength to use</li>
        <li>Trollslayer was doing 1d4+1 base damage, not the listed 2d4+1</li>
        <li>A handful of items had discrepancies between their listed and actual weight</li>
        <li>The cleric spell Find Traps would interrupt the caster every round for its duration with a casting animation. This was a bear to fix, but the revised version should detect traps without interrupting the caster. </li>

            <li>Various areas were not flagged as having day/night cycles</li>

        <li>There was a bug thread of unreported issues over on <acronym title="Spellhold Studios">SHS</acronym> from         guest poster -Mike-. Most were already fixed in v2, but the rest are now addressed in v3:
          <ul>

        <li>Added several new fixes courtesy of devSin, who had his own SEKRIT, unreleased fixpack that he was kind enough         to share. The majority of fixes in this version is thanks to combing through his personal fixes and applying them </li>
