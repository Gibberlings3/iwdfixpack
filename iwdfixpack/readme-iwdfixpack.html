        <p>The Icewind Dale Fixpack is designed to fix several bugs and errors that remain in the game after the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/943-official-patches-icewind-dale/">official       patches</a> have been applied. It works  with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster       installed. In fact, many issues quietly fixed by Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremaster have been rolled back       to every version of the game. This  is for the original Icewind Dale games, not the newer Enhanced Editions. </p>
        <p>This originally started as a component of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Tweak Pack, but was       broken out in to its own mod because 1) it's gotten fairly extensive on its own and 2) it should be installed       right after the official patches whereas the tweaks should be last installed. </p>

        <p>A good roundup of <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/24870-iwd-mod-install-order-thread/">install order for <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> mods</a> is available on the forums.</p>
        <p>The Fixpack works with or without the expansions Heart of Winter and Trials      of the Luremaster. It should be installed after official patches but before other mods, with one exception.</p>
        <p> The Animation fixes for Icewind Dale: <acronym title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotLM</acronym> [<acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1pp</acronym>] mod can potentially nullify fixes--specifically, if       you install the 'enable combat stance animations' component and choose the 'Replace scripts' option. Using       the component with the 'Keep Old Scripts' option should be safe, and should follow the Fixpack in the install       order. Using the 'Replace scripts' option is <strong>not</strong> recommended, but if you insist, install it before the Fixpack. </p>
        <p>Auril's Bane also overwrites a number of files and introduces its own fixes, which are not as extensive as       the Fixpack. Because Auril's Bane also overwrites a number of files it can also negatively affect the fixes       provided by this mod.</p>

      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Icewind Dale Fixpack for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> iwdfixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>MacOS</strong><br />
        The Icewind Dale Fixpack for macOS  is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-iwdfixpack</strong>, <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> iwdfixpack</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-iwdfixpack.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Icewind Dale Fixpack for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not   include a WeiDU installer.  Linux users will need to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall iwdfixpack' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-iwdfixpack --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

      <p>The Icewind Dale Fixpack has two components. If Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremaster is installed,       it will detect them and install relevant fixes for them as well.</p>
      <p><strong>Fixpack</strong></p>
      <p>This component contains the heavy lifting of the mod, fixing bugs and errors throughout the game. For       anyone familiar with the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack, the ideas behind identifying       and fixing bugs is equivalent. While some bugs are clearly bugs, the mod also has a review process for      'gray area' bugs to insure that fixes do not contradict developer intent.      The result is a component which aims to address true bugs      only and in a manner consistent with Bioware's original goals. <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/subpages/iwd_fixpack/iwd_fixpack_docs/">Complete documentation</a> is available on the <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> web site. Additionally, the complete <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/152-icewind-dale-mod-roundup/">Fixpack      forums</a> are open, so if you want to see the reasoning behind a bugfix      (or tell us we've got it all wrong), please join us on the forums and provide      feedback. If you find a bug that is not fixed, please report it. </p>
      <p><strong>Game Text Update</strong></p>
      <p>This component corrects various typos, errors, and other mistakes in the game strings. (A string is any bit       of text used by then engine--it could be a line of dialogue, an item description, a creature's name, etc.)       A <em>very</em> minimalist approach has been taken, in that strings are only introduced for obvious errors and not,       for example, to make formatting consistent in item descriptions. This component fixes about 400 strings, most of       which were string fixes silently introduced by <acronym title="Heart of Winter">HoW</acronym> or <acronym title="Trials of the Luremaster">TotL</acronym> and now applied to every engine variant. The overwhelming       majority of these are to correct typos in the game though there are some notable exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Descriptions for the Incinerator and Frostbrand omitted their fire resistance bonuses</li>
        <li>In <acronym title="Heart of Winter">HoW</acronym>, the time required for Nym to enchant a shield for you         was reduced from ten to three days, but one line of dialogue was not updated to reflect this change</li>
        <li>Haste now mentions its fatigue effect</li>
        <li>The description for the Mage Dagger +4 omitted its <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> bonus and         had incorrect damage and <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> bonuses</li>
        <li>Several spells had incorrect schools listed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is by no means a comprehensive list.</p>
      <p>While this component is available for all languages, only the handful of string changes (seven or less) are       actually applied to non-English games. However, the framework is in place to expand these components (and       languages can alter strings independent of one another) so if any translating groups want to put together      a <acronym title="Game Text Update">GTU</acronym> for their language, I'll be happy to include it in future versions. </p>
      <p>Regardless, for any language variant, I'll happily take corrections and fixes in the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/152-icewind-dale-mod-roundup/">mod forum</a>. </p>

      <p>First, a big thanks to the wonderful community at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">The      Gibberlings Three</a>. Thanks to the still active and vibrant Infinity      Engine modding community. </p>
      <p>First, a huge thank you to devSin, my right-hand man and co-conspirator from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack. After version 1 of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Fixpack was released he was kind enough to share his own, personal       project he had put together for the game to fix a number of bugs. These fixes formed the backbone of the second       version of the Fixpack and helped correct some missteps in v1. </p>

      <p>Huge thanks to grogerson for his assistance, playtesting, bug reports, and suggestions, particularly for       the second generation of <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> Tweaks, which led to this mod. Thanks       also to Daulmakan and the various unnamed guests who helped      report bugs and other issues. Thanks to Kaelas for the Talon of the Gloomfrost fix. Cheers      to Petor23 and Da_Venom for help testing! Version 2 also includes fixes reported (and in some cases fixed, too)       by plainab, redrake, Pacek, Ayrus, and Geeze. Big thanks to guest poster -Mike- on the <acronym title="Spellhold Studios">SHS</acronym> forums who helped identify (and fix) issues with       versions 2 and 3 of the mod. </p>

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 3 - September 24, 2012</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There was a bug thread of unreported issues over on <acronym title="Spellhold Studios">SHS</acronym> from         guest poster -Mike-. Most were already fixed in v2, but the rest are now addressed in v3:
          <ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Documentation split out and expanded in the style of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack v10</li>
        <li>Added several new fixes courtesy of devSin, who had his own SEKRIT, unreleased fixpack that he was kind enough         to share. The majority of fixes in this version is thanks to combing through his personal fixes and applying them </li>
        <li>Corrections from v1
          <ul>
            <li>The paperdoll fixes were being applied to human female fighters, breaking them (redrake)</li>
            <li>Random Treasure Table leaves the undroppable, valid items to keep the original weighting of the table</li>
            <li>Identified additional enemies in the Severed Hand that were healing the party</li>
            <li>Rolled back some of the sahuagin priestess script fixes (specifically,             the <acronym title="Death Variable">DV</acronym> changes) as they were working as intended</li>
            <li>Adjusted the bug with Marketh's thieves spawning on top of each other to be a little more robust and a lot more compact</li>
            <li>The fix for Misery's Herald worked and provided Horror on   hit, but it propagated the existing            erroneous saves. This is corrected, and an additional   safeguard to prevent Horror from affecting undead has been added. </li>
            <li>The English Game Text Update was killing the narration in one of the chapter breaks, which is fixed. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 1 - February 6, 2011</strong></p>
      <ul>
