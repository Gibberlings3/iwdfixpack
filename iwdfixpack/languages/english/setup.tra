@106394 = ~Decastave
(Evocation)
Level: 2
Range: Caster 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1-6 hit points of damage per hit, and it can hit creatures immune to normal weapons. It is a staff, however, so if the caster does not have a proficiency in staff weapons, then the Decastave is used at a penalty. The staff also has the power to drain a target of 1-2 hit points on every strike. These hit points are added to the caster's, but they can only heal damage the caster has taken; they will not raise his hit points beyond his normal maximum.~
@109764 = ~This weapon was used by the human ranger Althax Grom.  Althax hated the giants that plagued his homeland and was trained to exterminate them from a young age.  Although Althax originally fought his foes using the sword and bow, he quickly decided that those weapons were too slow against his huge foes.  His druid friend, Eladan, enchanted this hammer for him.  The reputation of the weapon grew as legends of Althax grew.  Even though the warhammer has passed through many hands since Althax's untimely demise, Giant's Sleep will always be remembered as the weapon of that powerful warrior.

@112174 = ~Chromatic Orb (Evocation)
Level: 1
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 
This spell creates a 4-inch-diameter sphere that can be hurled unerringly to its target. The orb's effect depends on the level of the wizard: a 1st-level sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and blinds the target for one round. A 2nd-level sphere inflicts 1-6 damage and inflicts pain upon the victim. A 3rd-level sphere deals 1-8 damage and burns the victim. A 4th-level sphere deals 1-10 damage and blinds the target for four rounds. A 5th to 6th-level sphere deals 1-12 damage and stuns the target for three rounds. The 7th to 9th-level sphere deals 2-16 damage and paralyzes the victim for 13 rounds.~

// vocalize only affects the caster
@112182 = ~Vocalize (Alteration) 
Level: 2
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 
The wizard can cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise, so long as the casting takes place entirely within the duration of the Vocalize spell. This spell has no effect on other noises or speech - it simply removes a spell's verbal component. This spell is a great counter for Silence 15' Radius.~

// War Hammer of Phasing +2 descript, says hammer causes disease when it causes phasing
@114959 = ~Like others of its type, this warhammer is made entirely of steel, with a bone-crushing hammer mounted upon an 18" shaft.  It has also been bestowed with a small number of magical properties, however, thus making it more effective in combat.
